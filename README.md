## Professional Pitch

 I am a software developer passionate for creating tools to solve “unsolvable” problems. Before becoming a software developer, I worked as a project manager at a small software development and web design company where I worked with a team of designers and developers to create a web application for British Petroleum. I decided to change my career to become a professional in software development because I wanted to use my creativity and problem-solving skills to build tools that will help people in need and solve difficult issues.

## What excites me about tech?

Having the unobstructed ability to build and design an unlimited variety of tools with incredible potential to create a huge impact for their users has me extremely excited for my future in the tech industry.
